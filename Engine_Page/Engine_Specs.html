            one-barrel carburetor and delivered around 155 horsepower at 4200 RPM with 
            235 lb-ft of torque at 1600 RPM. Known for its smooth operation and solid 
            reliability, the 250 was a popular choice in Chevy and GMC trucks, offering a

            only two engines offered exclusively in 1967 Chevy and GMC trucks. Despite 
            its smaller size, the 283 delivered strong, dependable performance and helped
